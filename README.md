 # Joke Bot with Writer-Critic Loop

This project implements an agentic joke-generating bot using LangGraph and the Groq API. The bot features a writer-critic loop where a Large Language Model (LLM) generates jokes (Writer) and another LLM evaluates them (Critic) before presenting them to the user. Rejected jokes are sent back to the Writer for revision, with a limit on retries. The bot also supports multiple languages and keeps track of generated jokes to avoid repetition.


## Features

    Writer-Critic Loop: Employs two LLMs for joke generation and evaluation.
    Retry Mechanism: Rejected jokes are regenerated by the Writer (up to a limit).
    Multilingual Support: Generates jokes in various languages.
    Joke History: Avoids repeating recently told jokes.
    Interactive Menu: Allows users to get the next joke, change category, change language, or quit.

## Technologies Used

    LangGraph: For building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.
    Groq API: Provides fast and scalable LLM inference for joke generation and critique.
    Python: The primary programming language.
    Pydantic: For defining the state of the joke bot.
